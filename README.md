- **Multiple Command Support**:
  - "Guard my room", "Protect my room", "Start guard mode"
  - "Stop guard mode", "Deactivate guard"
  - "Enroll face", "Register face"

###  Facial Recognition & Management
- **Trusted Face Database**: Secure storage of authorized individuals
- **Real-time Face Detection**: Continuous monitoring with OpenCV
- **Automatic Enrollment**: Easy addition of new trusted faces via webcam
- **Unknown Person Tracking**: Escalation system for unauthorized individuals

###  Intelligent Escalation System
- **Level 1**: Polite inquiry and identification request
- **Level 2**: Firm warning with authority notifications
- **Level 3**: Intruder alert with alarm activation and evidence capture

###  Multi-Channel Alert System
- **Slack Integration**: Real-time webhook notifications
- **Local Logging**: Comprehensive security event logging
- **Visual Alarms**: Flashing alert displays
- **Audio Alarms**: Text-to-speech warnings

###  Technical Capabilities
- **Real-time Audio Processing**: Continuous microphone monitoring
- **Camera Management**: Thread-safe webcam access
- **Resource Optimization**: Efficient memory and CPU usage
- **Error Handling**: Robust exception management

##  Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Webcam and microphone
- Internet connection for AI services

### Required Libraries
```bash
pip install whisper opencv-python face-recognition pyttsx3 sounddevice google-genai python-dotenv requests
```

### Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file with:
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
GUARD_WEBHOOKS=your_slack_webhook_url_here
```

##  Usage

### Starting the System

```

## Configuration Options

### System Parameters
- **Sample Rate**: 16000 Hz (audio)
- **Chunk Size**: 2 seconds (audio processing)
- **Face Recognition Tolerance**: 0.5
- **Escalation Timers**: 60s (Level 2), 120s (Level 3)

### Customization
- Modify activation phrases in `activation_phrases`
- Adjust escalation thresholds in `escalation_levels`
- Configure notification channels in `_load_notification_config`

##  Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Camera Access**: Ensure no other application is using the webcam
2. **Microphone Permissions**: Grant audio access to Python
